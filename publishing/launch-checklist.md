# RALPH Publishing Checklist

## 1) Prepare the repo
- Confirm `core/`, `adapters/`, and `templates/` are complete.
- Add at least one end-to-end example in `docs/`.
- Ensure README includes compatibility matrix and quick start.

## 2) Publish to GitHub
- Create public repository (source of truth).
- Push `main` and add release tag `v0.1.0`.
- Add topics: `prompt-engineering`, `agent-framework`, `traceability`, `prd`.

## 3) Share externally
- LinkedIn post: problem -> framework -> evidence -> repo link.
- Optional short demo video showing the loop with artifacts.

## 4) Adoption support
- Add a "getting started" issue template.
- Add a roadmap issue for Codex/Claude parity improvements.
- Track feedback and cut `v0.1.1` quickly.
