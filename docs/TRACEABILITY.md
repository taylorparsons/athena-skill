# Traceability (How to follow the audit trail)

Start here:
1) Locate raw requests in `docs/requests.md` (`CR-...`).
2) Locate interpretation/tradeoff decisions in `docs/decisions.md` (`D-...`).
3) Read source-of-truth requirements in `docs/PRD.md`.
4) Read feature spec(s) in `docs/specs/<FEATURE_ID>/spec.md` (`FR-...`, `Verifies: FR-...`).
5) Read task execution mapping in `docs/specs/<FEATURE_ID>/tasks.md` (`T-...`, `Implements: FR-...`).
6) Review execution evidence in `docs/progress.txt`.
