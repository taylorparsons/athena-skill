IN PROGRESS
- (none)

NEXT
- (none)

NOTES
- Commands run: security audit before/after low-priority hardening plus git config update for signing.
- Validation: audit findings for `CODEOWNERS`, Dependabot, workflow, and `commit.gpgsign` resolved.
- Note: commit hashes from pre-rewrite history were intentionally discarded as part of clean-history publication requirement.
- Commands run: targeted `rg` checks for traceability IDs and path hygiene plus file-presence checks for walkthrough artifacts.
- Validation: walkthrough references resolved; no local absolute paths detected in new docs; required `docs/examples` and spec/task files exist.
- Resume handling: provided UUID was not found in repo files, so execution resumed from tracked NEXT backlog item per `D-20260211-1326`.
