NOTES
- Commands run: security audit before/after low-priority hardening plus git config update for signing.
- Validation: audit findings for `CODEOWNERS`, Dependabot, workflow, and `commit.gpgsign` resolved.
- Note: commit hashes from pre-rewrite history were intentionally discarded as part of clean-history publication requirement.
