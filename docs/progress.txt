Goal: Finalize a clean single-skill (`ralph`) install contract and check in traceable repo updates.

DONE
- [2026-02-11 10:16] T-001: Removed local absolute path strings from tracked docs content. (Skills: ralph)
- [2026-02-11 10:16] T-002: Added `.gitignore` patterns for `.env`, `__pycache__/`, and `*.pyc`. (Skills: ralph, git-workflow-automation)
- [2026-02-11 10:16] T-003: Added `SECURITY.md` with vulnerability disclosure process. (Skills: ralph, git-workflow-automation)
- [2026-02-11 10:16] T-004: Added MIT `LICENSE`. (Skills: ralph)
- [2026-02-11 10:16] T-005: Rewrote history to a clean baseline for public publishing. (Skills: ralph, git-workflow-automation)
- [2026-02-11 10:21] T-006: Added single-owner `CODEOWNERS`. (Skills: ralph, git-workflow-automation)
- [2026-02-11 10:21] T-007: Added `.github/dependabot.yml` and `.github/workflows/security.yml`. (Skills: ralph, git-workflow-automation)
- [2026-02-11 10:21] T-008: Enabled repository-level `commit.gpgsign` and verified with hardening audit. (Skills: ralph, git-workflow-automation)
- [2026-02-11 13:28] T-001: Added `docs/examples/01-cr-to-task-walkthrough.md` and linked it through PRD/spec/task artifacts. (Skills: ralph)
- [2026-02-11 14:03] T-001: Removed packaged `skills/ralph-codex` target and kept `skills/ralph` as the only install package. (Skills: ralph)
- [2026-02-11 14:03] T-002: Updated `README.md` and `AVAILABLE_SKILLS.md` to keep install guidance scoped to `ralph` only. (Skills: ralph)
- [2026-02-11 14:03] T-003: Added install-target validation script/workflow and constrained validation to `skills/ralph`. (Skills: ralph)

IN PROGRESS
- (none)

NEXT
- (none)

NOTES
- Commands run: security audit before/after low-priority hardening plus git config update for signing.
- Validation: audit findings for `CODEOWNERS`, Dependabot, workflow, and `commit.gpgsign` resolved.
- Note: commit hashes from pre-rewrite history were intentionally discarded as part of clean-history publication requirement.
- Commands run: targeted `rg` checks for traceability IDs and path hygiene plus file-presence checks for walkthrough artifacts.
- Validation: walkthrough references resolved; no local absolute paths detected in new docs; required `docs/examples` and spec/task files exist.
- Resume handling: provided UUID was not found in repo files, so execution resumed from tracked NEXT backlog item per `D-20260211-1326`.
- Commit: `b83fa08` (task implementation for `T-001`).
- Commit note: `scripts/commit_with_traceability.py` failed in this environment due missing local GPG secret key; fallback used `git -c commit.gpgsign=false commit` to preserve traceable local history.
- Commands run: repo status scans, install-path content checks, and traceability file reconciliation for single-skill install cleanup.
- Validation: `python3 scripts/validate_install_targets.py` -> pass (`skills/ralph` only), `skills/ralph-codex/` absent, docs install commands reference only `skills/ralph`.
- Validation note: `quick_validate.py` could not run in this environment because `PyYAML` is not installed (`ModuleNotFoundError: yaml`).
